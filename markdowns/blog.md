I write mostly about the research projects I am involved and teaching/academic life. <br />

**Important note**: I decided to post exclusively on Medium (On my [personal account](https://medium.com/@rocha.carla) or in [LAPPIS account](https://medium.com/@lappisunbfga)).

**Important note 2**: these posts might have typos or weird wording (and most of them written in Portuguese). Although I might be aware of some of these issues, I do not plan to fix any of them. This is because writing takes time. If I want my blog posts to be free of typos, I might ended up not publishing anything, because I may need to polish them a lot (since I'm not a native English speaker, this takes even more time). So many of these blog posts are not polished.<br />
